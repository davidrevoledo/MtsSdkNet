Some definitions are repeated, thus some manual changes are required for successful build.
PreBuild: 
In JSON schemas we must delete the following where there are 'definitions" (so far only in schemas for Responses):
    "description": "Defines commonly used types",
    "required": [
      "code"
    ],

Note: in order to easier find/replace Properties that should be of type 'long', before generation change all apropriate fields in schemas to 'number'. Then they will be 'double' and you can just search/replace all.

PostBuild:
Problem:
Some objects are defined in more then 1 schema.
There are actually 2 different 'Sender' objects defined. One full sender object, second only with SenderId.

Solution:
Leave full one in MtsTicket.cs
Rename 'small' object in MtsTicketAck.cs to 'SenderSummary'.
Correct in the rest of the classes to use SenderSummary.
Resolve the rest of duplicate definitions.
Correct all parameters, which should be 'long' (by generator they are 'int')
